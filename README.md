# scrabble-score
A basic coding exercise

I used this exercise to practice testing with Ruby programs.  As such, there are both an RSpec test, and a Minitest.

#Using the Program
Simply run <script>ruby init.rb</script>, and it will ask you to put input a word.  It will then provide a scrabble score for the word.
