# scrabble-score
A basic coding exercise

This exercise was found from https://gist.github.com/elle/b9739bc21eb348916a60622f3fb6e2e4

# Using the Program
Simply run `ruby init.rb` and it will ask you to put input a word.  It will then provide a scrabble score for the word.

Tests are done using both RSpec and Minitest as I was trying to learn how to use both.
